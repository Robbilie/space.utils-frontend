# space.utils - frontend
In this repository you will find the frontend source code for https://utils.space/.
This is based on a starter kit to get SSR running quickly https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit .
Offline storage support was added and a load of the template code stripped away, not everything yet though.
Data shown in this UI is received through https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/ from the EVE Online ESI API as well as my own swagger backend.
